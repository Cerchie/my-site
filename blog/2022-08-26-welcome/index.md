This is my blog! I've organized the content by tags:

[seeds](/blog/tags/seeds) - These are notes and half-baked thoughts.

[sprouts](/blog/tags/sprouts) - These are blog and talk drafts, or more rambling trains of thought that still have structure.

[trees](/blog/tags/sprouts) - These are fully fledged blog posts, or even essays!

There are other tags, too of course, but those will have to do with topics and less to do with the content's position in my garden.

Hope you enjoy clicking around. ðŸŒ±
